Description :
=============
I,  K.M. Arun Kumar alias Arunkumar Murugeswaran, just shared my works, in which I worked as a learning path and practiced Embedded C programming using PIC18F452 (Microchip's 8-bit microcontroller in PIC18 family) such as a 16-bit whole number arithmetic calculator. 

CAUTION:
========
Schematics and simulations are done by Proteus CAD. NOT EXPERIMENTED IN A REAL-TIME ENVIRONMENT.

Purpose :
=========
In all my respective repositories, I just shared the works that I worked as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated, and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentation, and all other related files and some programming that might not be implemented, not being completed, lacks some features or have some bugs. The purpose of all my repositories, if used, can be used for LEARNING AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY. It can be used as open source and freeware. Kindly read the LICENSE.txt for license, terms, and conditions about the use of source codes, binaries, documentation, and all other files, located in all my repositories. 

My Thanks and Tribute :
========================
I thank my family, Friends, Teachers, People behind the toolchains and references that I used, and all those who directly or indirectly supported me and/or helped me and/or my family, Nature, and God. My tribute to my family, Friends, Teachers, People behind the toolchains and references that I used, Nature, Jimmy Dog, God, and all those, who directly or indirectly help and/or support me and/or my family.
